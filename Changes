Revision history for XML::Comma modules:

-------------------------
1.00  2002/01/28 03:46:15
-------------------------
  - boolean macro bugfix

  - new features in HTTP_Transfer

  - faster $index->count() SQL
 
  - added iterator_select_returnval() method to Index Iterator class

  - new boolean- (and grouping-) capable collection and sort
    specs. implemented using Parse::RecDescent -- core code now
    requires Parse::RecDescent to be available

  - added validate() method to Element, NestedElement and BlobElement
    classes. validate_structure() is now DEPRECATED. storage write
    methods all call validate() and refuse to store Docs that fail to
    pass all validity checks. it's now possible to define
    validate_hooks for blob elements.

1.01  2002/04/10 12:05:32
-------------------------

  - Changed Comma_Standard_Image.def to use hex (rather than b64)
    digests, to eliminate the +/= characters that could cause problems
    in urls.

  - Added doc_id() method to Storage::Iterator. Returns the doc_id of
    the currently-pointed-at doc.

  - Improved $index->rebuild() code. Fixed bug in stop_rebuild_hook
    handler, added parallelization ('workers=>n' arg). Added sig
    handler to catch Ctrl-C and try to clean up, so as to not leave db
    tables in a "marked" state.

  - Added Methodable::method_names() method so that Def and Index
    objects can return the names of the methods they define.
  
  - Added $def->index_names() and $def->store_names() methods.

  - Fixed Index::Iterator bug found by TIB that was triggered by
    trying to access columns from an empty iterator.

  - Rewrote Index plurals code. Added a new type of storage
    ('bcollection table'), and integrated 'sort' and 'collection'
    types together. Rewrote SQL code generation and all t/indexing.t
    tests. Added more boolean/notting and partial match capabilities
    into the new collections framework.

  - Added some cleanup code to Index->DESTROY to resolve circular
    references that were causing occasional problems with global
    destruction.
