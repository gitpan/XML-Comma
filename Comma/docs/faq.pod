XML::Comma FAQ - frequently asked questions about XML::Comma

=head1 DESCRIPTION

XML::Comma is an information management platform. It was designed to
be used as a core tool for developing Very Large Websites. Comma
specifies an XML-based document definition format, encourages Perl
code to be embedded in these definitions, and specifies an API for
manipulating documents and document collections. Comma includes
functionality to store sets of documents in ordered, extensible ways,
and integrates with a relational database to index, sort and retrieve
collections of documents.

=head1 CODE QUESTIONS

=head2 What's the difference between $foo->bar() and $foo->element('bar')->get()?

This is really a question about Comma's "shortcut" syntax, which
defines a mapping between method calls and the elements of a given
container.

There is a section on the shortcut syntax in the guide that goes into
more detail, but here is a quick list of the seven possible ways a
shortcut can can be resolved.

  $x->foo ( [@args] )                  # becomes:
  $x->method('foo, @args)              # if there is a method "foo"
  $x->element('foo')                   # singular, nested
  $x->elements('foo')                  # plural, nested
  $x->element('foo')->get()            # singular, non-nested, no @args 
  $x->element('foo')->set(@args)       # singular, non-nested, with @args
  $x->elements_group_get('foo')        # plural, nested, no @args
  $x->elements_group_set('foo', @args) # plural, nested, with @args

=head2 How do I tell how many instances of a given plural element exist?

Because the elements() method always tries to return a "list" of
elements -- which means that it returns an array in list context and a
reference to an array in scalar context -- you have to do a bit of
extra work to determine how many instances of a plural element
exist. The most concise (and the recommended) way to do this is:

  my $how_many_foos = scalar ( @{$doc->elements('foo')} );

=head2 What does the BAD_CONTENT error that talks about '& found that isn't part of an entity reference' mean?

You have a problem that boils down to something along these lines:

  $doc->element('some_element')->set ( "foo & bar" );

Element content must be legal XML -- so no &lt;, &gt;, or &amp;
characters are allowed. These special characters must be "escaped" by
replacing them with their entity codes (respectively &amp;lt;,
&amp;gt;, or &amp;amp;). The C<Comma::Util::XML_basic_escape()> and
C<Comma::Util::XML_basic_unescape()> methods are available, as are
shortcut flags for the element C<set()> and C<get()> methods:

  $doc->element('some_element()->set ( "foo & bar", escape=>1 );
  $doc->element('some_element')->get ( unescape=>1 );
  $doc->some_element ( "foo & bar", escape=>1 );

Note that there is no way to pass the C<unescape> flag in the
shortcut-get syntax (so there are three examples above, rather than
four). It is fair to construe this as a problem with the API.

=head2 What does an error that ends 'sh: /tmp/log.comma: Permission denied' mean?

Comma writes a line about all un-caught errors to a log file. The
location of the log file is controlled by a setting in Comma.pm -- the
default is C</tmp/log.comma/>. This file probably needs to be writable
by any processes that use the Comma framework. In most installations,
the file is made world-writable (which should tell you that the Comma
log system isn't intended to be used as part of any security auditing
or similar framework -- you should write additional code to handle any
secure reporting that an application might need.)


=head1 PERFORMANCE

=head2 Is XML::Comma fast?

Sure. We don't know of any faster way to develop (or to add new
features to) large-scale applications that manipulate collections of
hundreds of thousands of pieces of messy-but-structured
information. We use it every day, and so do many, many people who
access the web sites we build.

Oh, wait: you meant, "does it run fast?" Well, that's in the eye of
the beholder. Comma's bottleneck is the parsing and object-ifying of
XML files. The power and flexibility that the API gives you comes at
some cost -- a hand-coded, special-purpose implementation could well
be faster for any single usage.

However, we've worked hard to make Comma fast enough to be really,
really, useful. For example, Comma's "Inline" parser is about twice as
fast as the general-use XML parsers against which we've benchmarked it
(because Comma documents aren't allowed to make use of all parts of
the XML specification). An experienced designer of large-scale
internet systems will easily be able to structure and tune a
Comma-based system to serve hundreds of thousands of dynamic pages a
day on mid-range x86 boxes.
